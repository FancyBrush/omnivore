OMNIVORE

A collection of tools for streaming video and analog/digital time series
to disk.  Frames are hardware triggered to insure synchronization with time
series over long time periods.  Multiple cameras and multiple analog/digital
channels can be recorded simultaneously.  Designed for behavioral and
physiological neuroscience experiments.  Analog/digital output is also
supported.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Any Matlab-supported camera and data acquisition board.  Tested with Basler
firewire and Pointgrey USB cameras, and M- and X-Series National Instruments
data acquisition boards.

A Microsoft Windows computer.

Matlab 2013a or newer, plus the Data Acquisition, Image Acquisition, Signal
Processing, and Statistics toolboxes.
